# First week of your thesis project

## Problem definition

Create an initial problem definition that captures your understanding of the thesisâ€™ goals.

* description of problem
* research question / approach to a solution
* what a first prototype might be
* rough schedule 

Write this down in README.MD

## Literature 

Decide on where you are going to track of literature. This can be Zotero, Jabref + Evernote, Jabref + Excel, etc. 

When you read any paper, add it to your list, and write down a few notes with a summary of the paper, and how it is relevant (or not) for your thesis.
This will also help you with writing your thesis later.

Find 2-4 papers for your topic and summarize them in this system.  

## Lab notebook

Decide on where you are going to keep your lab notebook. This can be an .MD file on Github, Word, Evernote, etc. 

Consider it like a captain's log on a ship. Every day you work on the project, you write what you did, what didn't work, why you decided 
to try something else, a screenshot of the results, etc. 

The notebook is for yourself, but you can bring it to the meeting to discuss problems and results. Also the notebook will help your future
self to figure out what you did when you want to write your thesis. 


## Todo list

Decide on where you are going to track of all your tasks. This can be on Github (via issues or projects), Todoist, Trello, or a paper planner. Make a habit
of creating tasks for yourself, such that each task can be completed in a few hours. This means the task has to have a verb, and have a definition of "complete".
For example, "Summarize 5 papers on topic X". 

If a todo comes up for you during the meeting, capture it straight away - either in your system, or write it on paper and add it to your system later.
